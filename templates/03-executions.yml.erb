# Each script will be executed on the target server.
# It should be written assuming bash script language
# and you can mix ruby code to preprocess.
#
# For instance, if you want to install a lot apt-get
# packages, you could do something like:
#
# <%% ["a", "b", "c", "d"].each do |pkg| %>
# apt-get install <%%= pkg %>
# <%% end %>
#
# Example of script section contents:
#
# executions:
# - description: Install Apache
#   file: install_apache
# 
# - description: Install MySQL
#   file: install_mysql
# 
# - description: Install PHP
#   file: install_php
#
# This would search the script/ folder for
# install_apache.sh.erb, isntall_mysql.sh.erb and
# install_php.sh.erb
#
executions: 
<% if executions %>
<% executions.each do |s| %>
- description: <%= s.first.titleize %>
  file: <%= s.first %>
<% end %>
<% end %>
