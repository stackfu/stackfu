#
# Requirements are things you want to be checked before 
# allowing this stack to be installed.
#
# This is an easy way to make sure all your components
# dependencies are correctly installed.
#
# Types of dependencies:
#
#   file          - a given file exists
#   symlink       - a given symlink exists
#   directory     - a given directory exits
#   process       - a process is runnning
#   ruby_can_load - if ruby can load a given lib
#   ruby_gem      - if a given ruby gem is installed
# 
# - type: folder
#   data: "/var"
#   error: "You need /var folder before installing"
# - type: file
#   data: "/etc/init.d/mysql"
#   error: MySQL start script was not found
#
requirements: 

#
# Each script will be executed on the target server.
# It should be written assuming bash script language
# and you can mix ruby code to preprocess.
#
# For instance, if you want to install a lot apt-get
# packages, you could do something like:
#
# <%% ["a", "b", "c", "d"].each do |pkg| %>
# apt-get install <%%= pkg %>
# <%% end %>
#
# Example of script section contents:
#
# - description: Install Apache
#   file: install_apache
# 
# - description: Install MySQL
#   file: install_mysql
# 
# - description: Install PHP
#   file: install_php
#
# This would search the script/ folder for
# install_apache.sh.erb, isntall_mysql.sh.erb and
# install_php.sh.erb
#
scripts: 
<% scripts.each do |s| %>
- description: <%= s.titleize %>
  file: <%= s %>
<% end %>
#
# As opposed to requirements, validations are things you 
# want to be checked after the installation, to make sure
# the installation occurred successfully.
#
# In case something wrong happens, you can inform the
# user
#
# The validation types are the same as requirements.
#
# Example:
#
# - type: folder
#   data: "/etc/apache2"
#   error: Apache was not installed properly
#
